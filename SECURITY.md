# Reporting security vulnerabilities
Oracle values the independent security research community and believes that
responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security
and privacy of all our users.

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you
believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to
[secalert_us@oracle.com](mailto:secalert_us@oracle.com) preferably with a proof of concept. Please review some additional information on [how to report security vulnerabilities to Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/reporting.html). We encourage people who contact Oracle Security to use email encryption using [our encryption key](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/encryptionkey.html).

We ask that you do not use other channels or contact the project maintainers
directly.

Non-vulnerability related security issues including ideas for new or improved
security features are welcome on GitHub Issues.
