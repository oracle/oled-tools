# oled-tools

scripts, configs, etc. that collect and analyze data about the health of the
system in order to root cause and resolve any system issues.

## Components

gathering additional debug data from the system. Please review the
corresponding man pages for more details.

  crash
- memstate: Captures and analyzes various memory usage statistics on the
  running system
- filecache: List the paths of the biggest files present in the page cache
- dentrycache: Lists a sample of file paths which have active dentries in the
  dentry hash table
- kstack: Collects the kernel stack trace for selected processes, based on
  status or PID
- syswatch: Execute user-provided commands when CPU utilization reaches a
  threshold
